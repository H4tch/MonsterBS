# CppProjectBuilder
--------------------

The basic idea is that you run "./GenerateCppProject.sh MyProject.sh" to
"compile" tools and build scripts based on your project settings.


#### Example
You can build the hello-world project by running:
```
	./GenerateCppProject.sh HelloWorldProject.sh
```
