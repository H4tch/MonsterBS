The Monster Build System collection of scripts that make it painless to create,

on top of Make and Shell scripts.

	* Debug and Release builds
	* OS: Windows, Linux, and Mac
	* Arch: x86 and x86_64

* Static and Shared Library creation
* Out of source tree build output
* Header and library installation
* Packaging of release builds
* Documentation generation using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
* Batch script to launch Windows build
* Shell script to launch Linux/Mac build
* FreeDesktop.org's `.desktop` file generation/installation for Unix platforms
* LinesOfCode calculation script using `cloc-1.60.pl`


### Getting Started
* Make a copy of the 'Project.mk' file and name it to your project's name.
> cp Project.mk PROJECT_NAME.mk

* Open it and fill in the Metadata, Directories, Build Targets and other Fields

* Source files are automatically generated by detecting all `.cpp` files within
`SRCDIR`. This can be customized for other languages, or you can list the files
manually.

* Customize the Compilation settings. The '*FLAG' settings are applied to all
targets. Settings for a specific target are added by the '*_PROFILE' functions.

* Once finished with customization, your Project can be generated using Make.
> make PROJECT_NAME

* This will generate your Project into a folder named after your Project.
